Resources
	hardness - describes the difficulty of extraction of resource from the tile
	quantity - describes the total content of the resource in the tile
	remaining - describes the remaining content of resource in the tile
	is_active - boolean value that describes whether any resoure remains and if tile is still active
	content - dictionary of components of the ore that lists all components and the stoichiometric ratio of the components

	Chemical
		H2O - contains trace minerals

	Ore
		Chalcopyrite - CuFeS2 - 
		Chalcocite - Cu2S - 

	Energy
		Wood - Produces charcoal (25% effeciency by weight).

	Refined
		Charcoal - wood heated in low oxygen conditions. Removes water and volatile components. 30 MJ/kg. Burns 900C without bellows, 2000C 
					with bellows.

	Crafted

Industry
	Metallurgy
		Pyrometallurgy - 
		Hydrometallurgy - 
		Solvometallurgy - Ethylene glycol and FeCl3 used as reagents. Optimal conditions for 100% recovery = 90C, 0.5 mol/L FeCl3, 40 g ore
							per 1 L EG FeCl3 solution. Generates solid sulfur waste. Produces FeCl2 waste if using ore with Fe (chalcopyrite)
							Copper extracted using electrodepositing. FeCl3 regenerated during electrodepositing. During leeching of Cu from 
							ore, FeCl3 reduced to FeCl2.
							CuFeS2 + 3FeCl3 -> 4FeCl2 + CuCl + 2S
							Cu2S + 2FeCl3 -> 2FeCl2 + 2CuCl + S

	Purification
		Electrodeposition - Current applied to Cu(I) containing solution to rduce to Cu(0)
