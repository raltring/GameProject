Resources
	Raw
		H2O - contains trace minerals
		Chalcopyrite - CuFeS2 - 
		Chalcocite - Cu2S
		Wood - Produces charcoal (25% effeciency by weight).
	Refined
		Charcoal - wood heated in low oxygen conditions. Removes water and volatile components. 30 MJ/kg. Burns 900C without bellows, 2000C with bellows.

	Copper Ore Material Processing
		Pyrometallurgy - 
		Hydrometallurgy - 
		Solvometallurgy - Ethylene glycol and FeCl3 used as reagents. Optimal conditions for 100% recovery = 90C, 0.5 mol/L FeCl3, 40 g ore
							per 1 L EG FeCl3 solution. Generates solid sulfur waste. Produces FeCl2 waste if using ore with Fe (chalcopyrite)
							Copper extracted using electrodepositing. FeCl3 regenerated during electrodepositing. During leeching of Cu from 
							ore, FeCl3 reduced to FeCl2.
							CuFeS2 + 3FeCl3 -> 4FeCl2 + CuCl + 2S
							Cu2S + 2FeCl3 -> 2FeCl2 + 2CuCl + S
		Electrodeposition - Current applied to Cu(I) containing solution to rduce to Cu(0)
